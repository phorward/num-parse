# parse-num

JavaScript-style parseInt prefix parsing of strings for Rust.

This crate is intended to provide a fast, generic, easy to use `parseInt()`-like implementation for Rust.

Likewise in JavaScript, a `parseFloat()`-like implementation for float-types is also planned, therefore the crate is called `parse-num` already.
